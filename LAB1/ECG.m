% a certain period of time.P, Q, R, S, T waves are marked on the signal.

% The shape of the beats over time is not the same for a channel and each heartbeat 
% creates a different waveform than the previous one. Therefore, the ECG signal 
% is called a quasi-periodic signal. Also The shape of the same beat on two channels 
% is different from each other because these two leads are recorded from different 
% places of the body.
%% 
% part 2) For each R peak in the ECG signal, if an abnormality occurs in that 
% beat, we write the type of abnormality below it.

% Below is a brief explanation about the abnormalities you see in the high beats.
%% Aberrancy (ABERR)
% Aberrancy refers to a condition where the conduction of electrical impulses 
% through the heart is altered. This can lead to a widened QRS complex on the 
% ECG. Aberrant conduction often occurs during episodes of tachycardia, where 
% the impulse travels through the ventricles abnormally due to pre-existing bundle 
% branch block or other conduction system issues.
%% Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC)
% PVCs are early heartbeats originating from the ventricles. They are characterized 
% by:
%% 
% * A premature QRS complex that is typically wide and bizarre in shape.
% * A compensatory pause following the PVC.PVCs can be benign or indicate underlying 
% heart disease, especially if frequent or occurring in pairs or runs.
%% Fusion Beats
% Fusion beats occur when two electrical impulses reach the ventricles simultaneously, 
% one from a normal pacemaker and another from an ectopic focus. This results 
% in a QRS complex that has characteristics of both normal and abnormal beats, 
% appearing as a hybrid. Fusion beats are often seen in patients with PVCs and 
% can indicate the presence of both normal and abnormal conduction pathways.
%% Non-Paced Contractions (NPC)
% NPCs refer to heartbeats that occur without the influence of an artificial 
% pacemaker. These can be either normal sinus beats or ectopic beats originating 
% from various locations within the heart. The presence of NPCs can indicate issues 
% with the heart's intrinsic conduction system.
%% Atrial Premature Contractions (APC)
% APCs are early contractions originating in the atria. They are characterized 
% by:
%% 
% * An early P wave that differs in shape from normal sinus P waves.
% * A compensatory pause following the APC.APCs are common and often benign 
% but can lead to more significant arrhythmias if they occur frequently.
%% Non-Ectopic Sinus Contractions (NESC)
% NESCs refer to sinus beats that occur without any ectopic activity influencing 
% them. These beats originate from the sinoatrial node and maintain a regular 
% rhythm, indicating normal atrial function. NESCs are typically seen in healthy 
% individuals and reflect a stable cardiac rhythm.
%% Non-Atrial Premature Contractions (NAPC)
% NAPCs are contractions that arise from locations other than the atria, often 
% from the ventricles or junctional tissues. They may be similar to PVCs but originate 
% from different areas within the heart's conduction system. NAPCs can indicate 
% underlying cardiac issues, particularly if they occur frequently or in conjunction 
% with other arrhythmias.
